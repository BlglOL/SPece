    <h1>BlackHoles</h1>
    <p>A black hole is a region of spacetime where gravity is so strong that nothing – no particles or <br><br>even electromagnetic radiation 
         such as light – can escape from it. The theory of general relativity <br><br>predicts that a sufficiently compact mass can deform spacetime
          to form a black hole.Black holes are <br><br>really very simple becausethey have just two main parts – the Event Horizon and the
          Singularity.<br><br>The Event Horizon is the outer limit of the black hole.There are four types of black holes: stellar,<br><br>
           intermediate, supermassive, and miniature.The most commonly known way a black hole forms <br><br>is by stellar death.
            A black hole is a region of spacetimewhere gravity is so strong that<br><br> nothing
    – no particles or even electromagneticradiation such as light – can escape<br><br> from it. The theory of general relativity predicts that 
    a sufficiently <br><br>compact mass can deform spacetime to form a black hole<br><br>.have you ever wanted to go into a blackhole?If you leapt
    <br><br>heroically into a stellar-mass black hole, your body would be subjected <br><br>to a process called 'spaghettification' (no, really, it is). 
     The black hole's gravity <br><br>force would compress you from top to toe, while stretching you at the same time… thus, spaghetti
     <br><br>now if you wondered how black holes bend light? just look at the images below<br><br>.

     this picture is an example of a black hole bending light<br><br>
     <img src = "images/blackholebended.jpg" width = 297 length = 170> <br><br>
     this is the image thats shown after light has bended.<br><br>

     note:(these are not pictures of a real blackhole)<br><br>
     <h3>Something is strange about this black hole.</h3><br><br>
     Until recently, black holes seemed to come in only two sizes:
       either small remnants <br>of collapsed stars or gargantuan beasts with masses of millions or even
        billions of suns<br>
        This is the Black Hole Sagittarius A*: Super-Close but Strangely Quiet.<br><br>
       do you really think i will tell you the strange thing about this black hole.
