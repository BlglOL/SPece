    <h1>Galaxies</h1>
    <p>
       A galaxy is a huge collection of gas, dust, and billions of stars and their solar systems.<br><br> 
       A galaxy is held together by gravity.<br><br> 
       There are 3 main types of Galaxies spiral,eliptical, and irregular.<br><br> 
       Galaxies vary in sizes.<br><br> 
       There are dwarf galaxies that are smaller than most galaxies because the don't actually have a <br><br>super-massive
        black hole in the center.
       But there is one exception.<br><br> 
       The supergiant elliptical cD galaxy A2261-BCG has not been found to contain an active supermassive black hole, <br><br> 
       despite the galaxy being one of the largest galaxies known; ten times the size of a normal one. <br><br> </p>

       <h2>The milky way and other neighboring galaxies<br><br> </h2>
       <p>
       The Milky Way is a huge collection of stars, dust and gas.<br><br> 
       It's called a spiral galaxy because if you could view it from the top or bottom, it would look like a spinning pinwheel.<br><br>  
       The Sun is located on one of the spiral arms, about 25,000 light-years away from the center of the galaxy.<br><br> </p>

       <h3>the local group<br><br> </h3>
       <p>The Local Group is the galaxy group that includes the Milky Way.<br><br> 
         It has a total diameter of roughly 3 megaparsecs (10 million light-years; 9×1022 metres), and a total mass of the order of 2×1012 solar masses (4×1042 kg).<br><br> </p>
       
         <h3>The milky way's neighbor<br><br> </h3>

    <h4>The Andromeda galaxy<br><br> </h4>
    
<p>The Milky Way and the Andromeda Galaxy, our nearest spiral neighbor, are headed toward each other.<br><br> 
     In about five billion years, they may collide and merge.<br><br> 
     Who knows, maybe even eventually,<br><br> 
      Our remote descendants could be living in a large elliptical galaxy<br><br> </p>

      <p>the special thing about the andromeda galaxy is that <br><br> 
        Excluding the Large and Small Magellanic Clouds, visible from Earth's Southern Hemisphere, <br><br> 
        the Andromeda galaxy is the brightest external galaxy you can see.<br><br> 
         At 2.5 million light-years, it's the most distant thing most of us humans can see with the unaided eye<br><br> </p>

         <p>The Andromeda Galaxy is surrounded by a massive halo of hot gas<br><br> 
             that is estimated to contain half the mass of the stars in the galaxy.<br><br> 
             The nearly invisible halo stretches about a million light-years from its host galaxy,<br><br>
               halfway to our Milky Way Galaxy(that is far)<br><br> </p>
               
<h5>the Andromeda Galaxy is our closest neighboring non-dwarf galaxy but did you know that venus is the <br>closest planet to earth.not mars.
