  <h1>Moons</h1>
  What is a moon in science terms?<br><br>
A moon is an object that orbits a planet or something else that is not a star. <br><br>
Besides planets, moons can circle dwarf planets, large asteroids, and other bodies.<br><br>
 Objects that orbit other objects are also called satellites,<br><br> so moons are sometimes
 called natural satellites.<br><br>
 <h3>makes you wonder whats the biggest moon?</h3><br><br> 
 Because the atmosphere is so high,<br><br> 
  Titan was thought to be the largest moon in the solar system for a long time.<br><br>

not that one<br><br>
Titan is the second largest moon in our solar system. <br><br>
Only Jupiter's moon Ganymede is larger, by just 2 percent. <br><br>
Titan is bigger than Earth's moon, and larger than even the planet Mercury<br><br>
thats not even a cool moon.boooooooooooo.<br><br>
The surface of Saturn's moon Titan looks a bit<br><br>
 like Earth and a new study finally explains why. <br><br>
Saturn's largest moon Titan features some very Earth-like landscapes: <br><br>
lakes and rivers, labyrinthine canyons, and soft sand dunes. However, <br><br>
these geological formations on Titan are made of entirely different materials<br><br>

unlike earth,The Moon is unique in that it is the only spherical <br><br>
satellite orbiting a terrestrial planet. The reason for its shape<br><br>
 is a result of its mass being great enough so that gravity pulls <br><br>
 all of the Moon's matter toward its center equally.<br><br>
 <h2>Facts abut the Moon</h2> <br><br><br><br>

 It takes 27.3 days for the Moon to travel all <br><br>
 the way around the Earth and complete its orbit.<br><br><br><br>

 As the Moon travels, it rotates on its own axis, just like our planet. <br><br>
 It takes roughly the same amount of time for the Moon to make a full <br><br>
 rotation as it does for it to complete its orbit. This means we only<br><br>
  ever see around 60% of the Moon’s surface from Earth! The part that faces Earth<br><br>
  is known as the ‘near side’ and the other, the ‘far side’.<br><br>
 Its surface is home to mountains, huge craters and flat  <br><br>
 planes called ‘seas’ made of hardened lava. <br><br><br><br>

 The temperature on the Moon varies from super hot to<br><br>
  super cold! When the Sun hits its surface, temperatures can<br><br>
   reach a scorching 127°C. But when the Sun ‘goes down’,<br><br>
  temperatures can plummet to around -153°C. <br><br><br><br>

  Scientists aren’t entirely sure how the Moon formed. A popular theory is that <br><br>
  a Mars-sized rock, named Theia, crashed into Earth around 4.5 billion years ago.<br><br>
   The debris from the collision clumped together to make what is now… Our Moon!<br><br><br><br>
   

   The moon always shows the same face to the Earth<br><br>
thats it for now,folks.<br><br><br><br><br><br>
