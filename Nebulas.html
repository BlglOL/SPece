    <h1>Nebulae</h1>

    <p>A nebula is an enormous cloud of dust and gas occupying the space between stars<br><br> and acting as a nursery for new
        stars.
        The roots of the word come from Latin nebula, <br><br>which means a “mist, vapor, fog, smoke,
        exhalation.”
        Nebulae are made up of dust,<br><br> basic elements such as hydrogen and other ionized gases The temperature of
        the <br><br>gas
        in the nebula is about 10,000 degrees Celsius, and the
        central stars of planetary <br><br>nebulae are among the hottest stars in the Universe, with temperature in the
        range<br><br> of
        25,000 to over 200,000 degrees Celsius.thats a lot of celsius.</p><br><br>

    <p>i wonder what would happen if earth was hit by a nebulae?

        Will the planet be destroyed?<br><br>Likely not. With nebulae having densities ranging from 100 to 10,000
        particles per cubic <br><br>centimeter, it won't be massive enough to simply disintegrate the planet.
         This is despite <br><br>the fact that they're blazing at a few kilometers per second, and the planet will be molten.
    </p>(slightly less exciting then what i thought)<br><br><br><br>
    
        <p>Can you go inside a nebula?
        We're not going to fly through a nebula, not in the lifetimes<br><br> of anyone alive today. Possibly not ever
        in
        anyone's lifetime. But based on data from the<br><br> Hubble and Spitzer telescopes, we now have a feel for what it
        may
        be like to fly through <br><br>one of the most famous ones - the Orion nebulae.
        or you could watch this <a href=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DyurFEAIxRA target=”_blank”>video</a> by "what if" <br><br>in which
        they tell us how it would be if earth lived in a nebulae and how many times we died.<br><br>There is this nebulae called the "Eagle's gate" nebulae. you might have heard
        of it.
        The Eagle <br><br>Nebula, also known as Messier 16 or M16, is one of the most amazing sights you can see <br><br>in a large
        telescope. It's the location of several famous structures, including the stunning<br><br> Pillars of Creation, a
        star-forming region, depicted in the image above.
        Eagle <br><br>Nebula can be spotted through a telescope and it is best viewed during July.<br><br><br><br>
        no line to see here that will try its best to make you <a href=Galaxies.html>click</a> this
        link,<br><br>nothing,absolutely nothing to see here ;)
        <br><br> but if there was it would probably be a link to <a href=Galaxies.html>Galaxies</a> :)
