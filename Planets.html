    <h1>Planets</h1>
    The thing we live on is a Planet.<br><br>
    The closest things that are around us are planets.<br><br>
    The 2nd closest thing to us is a planet
    <h2>so,what is a planet?</h2>
    <p>an object orbiting a star which is large enough so that its gravity would pull it into an approximate sphere
        is called a planet.
        <br><br>So basically,ball go brrr round star = planet.
    </p><br><br>
    now that we have cleared what is a planet we are going to see what ...
    :/

    <h3>we are going to learn
        things about girth </h3>

    <h3>fun facts about earth</h3>
    Earth is not flat, but it's not perfectly round either. <br><br>
    The days are getting longer. <br><br>
    There weren't always several continents.<br><br>
    Earth's gravity isn't uniform. <br><br>
    In the past, sea levels were very different. <br><br>
    Our sun has a voracious appetite.<br><br>

    <br><br>
    ok maybe the last one wasn't about earth.but at least it's a fact,da te bayo.<br><br>


    this is a popular question : can we terraform mars?<br><br>
    (scienstific ans)<br><br>
    To break it down, only Enceladus and Titan appear to be viable candidates for<br><br>
    terraforming.However, in both cases, the process of turning them into habitable<br><br>
    worlds where human beings could exist without the<br><br>
    need for pressurized structures or protective suits would be a long and costly one.<br><br>
    <br> unlike earth,The Moon is unique in that it is the only <br><br>
    spherical satellite orbiting a terrestrial planet. The reason <br><br>
    for its shape is a result of its mass being great enough so that <br><br>
    gravity pulls all of the Moon's matter toward its center equally.<br><br>
    <br><br>
    <h4>What planet rains diamonds?</h4>
    Deep within Neptune and Uranus, it rains diamondsâ€”or so astronomers <br><br>
    and physicists have suspected for nearly 40 years.<br><br>
     The outer planets of our Solar System a<br><br>
    re hard to study, however. Only a single <br><br>
    space mission, Voyager 2, has flown by to reveal some of their secrets, <br><br>
    so diamond rain has remained only a hypothesis.<br><br>


    gir-earth has 1 moon <br><br>
    Sadturn has 82 moons. Fifty-three moons are confirmed<br><br>
    and another 29 moons are awaiting confirmation of discovery and official naming<br><br>
    Ju pitou r(jupiter) has 53 named moons. Others are awaiting official names. <br><br>Combined, scientists
    now think Jupiter has 79 moons. <br><br>
    <img src=images/mars.jpg_480Wx480H width=130> has 2- ya know what
    the solar system combined has 200+ moons.<br><br>
    <img src=images/mars.jpg_480Wx480H width=130> has the biggest mountain in the solar system.<br><br>
    can you cick on <a href=Moons.html>this</a> i
    <!-- dont -->
    promise it won't make you go to a webpage called <a href=Moons.html>Moons</a><br><br>
