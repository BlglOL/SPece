<!-- bi -->

           Stars are huge celestial bodies made mostly of hydrogen and helium that produce light and heat 
         by nuclear fusion</br> </br>of hydrogen atoms into helium in their dense core.Have you  ever wondered
         how stars got so big?Stars only have a </br></br>limited amount of time to gain
            mass before the star-forming material is blown away. So the key to forming
              a super-</br></br>massive star is getting extremely massive as
              fast as possible.But the drawback to this is that a
              massive star needs even </br></br> more helium to burn and
             when the hellium eventually runs out poof! naah
            i'm just joking what acctually happens is the 
        </br></br>core will expand and cool. The upper layers will
             expand and eject material that will collect 
    around the dying star to form a </br></br>planetary nebula. Finally, the core 
    will cool into a white dwarf and then eventually into a black dwarf. 
This entire process </br></br> will take a few billion years.</br><h3>Way less exciting than poof. </h3>
Our Sun is large enough that approximately 1.3 million Earths could fit inside (if squashed in) or
 if the Earths retained their <br> <br>spherical shape then 960,000 would fit.

        A solar system is a system in which there is a sun together with a group
         of celestial bodies that are held by its attraction <br><br> and revolve around it.
         our Solar System formed 4.6 Billion years ago.
        There are some wacky solar systems.Proxima <br><br>Centauri is one of these 
        stars.Proxima Centauri is the closest star to the Solar System.
        it also has a exoplanet named <br><br> Proxima Centauri b.
        Proxima Centauri  has six exoplanets, the highest number discovered 
        for any star within this range.<br><br> Most known nearby exoplanets orbit 
        close to their stars.

        A Binary star system is a system in which there are 2 stars directly orbiting
        each other.Astronomers don't know how being <br><br>in a binary star system affects
         potential habitability. But it's clear such systems provide conditions for
         life unlike any seen <br><br>in our solar system. Their study - published in the 
         peer-reviewed journal Nature explores binary-star planets.There are<br><br> Binary 
         solar systems too!!!If you are wondering that there are terrestrial planets
          in binary solar systems,yes there are infact<br><br> It is estimated that 50â€“60% 
          of binary stars are capable of supporting habitable terrestrial planets
           within stable orbital <br><br>ranges.

         <h2>What is the color of our star?</h2>


        The color of our star does appear to be whittish yellow when it is seen with the 
        naked eye.But scientists think otherwise.If<br><br> you could travel into space and look
        at the Sun without going blind, you'd find that it's actually white, and not
        yellow. Using<br><br> a prism, you can see how sunlight can be broken up into the 
        spectrum of its colors: red, orange, yellow, green, blue,<br><br> indigo and violet.
        did you know?that the coolest stars are red and the warmest stars are blue.
        It is a common<br><br> misconception that the Sun is yellow, or orange or even red.
         However, the Sun is essentially all colors mixed together<br><br>

    <img src = images/starcycle.jpg  alt = "a diagram of the life cycle of a star" width = 500 length = 259 />
    as you can probably see that first there is a <br><br>stellar nebula in which there is a small star and a massive star 
    A small star will become a red giant just not as big as the<br><br> massive star and explode only to become a planetary nebula the slowly
     become a white dwarf.MASSIVE STAR: the massive <br><br>star begins to lose hydrogen fuel for nuclear fusion, and has begun the process of 
    dying. when the star loses hydroen for <br><br>nuclear fusion,it starts to expandThis process can take up to 10 billion 
    years. When a star becomes a red giant, it will start to <br><br>expand and become denser till it  goes Boom!!! 
    (finally) and the result is a supernova.now it will become a newtron star or a blackhole.Did You know that there 
    are supermassive black holes in the center of every galaxy!!!!
