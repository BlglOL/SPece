    <h1>Space</h1>
    <p>Space, the seemingly infinite biome of stars,
        planets,moons,asteroids,comets and other debris.</br></br></p>
    <h2>What is Space?</h2>
    Space is the area beyond a planet's atmosphere,
    for earth it iss about <b>100 km(62 miles)above sea level.</b></br>
    the line that seperates an atmosphere from space is called the Kármán line.
    Space is almost an absolute vacuum, not because of
    suction but because it's nearly empty.
    <aside>Space is also reffered to as <b>
            interstellar space</b>.</aside>
    <h2>Anomaly's of space</h2>

    <h3> Space contains a lot of things such as :</h3>  </br> 
    <ul>
        <li><a href=Stars.html>Stars</a></li>
         <b>Stars</b> are gigantic masses of hot plasma.A star known as <b>Betelguese</b> 
        is a red giant right now.it is very close to its life's end.
        <li><a href=BlackHoles.html>Blackholes</a></li>
        <b>Blackholes</b> are space Anomaly's that can even trap something as fast as light
        <li><a href=Nebulas.html>Nebulas</a></li>
        <b>Nebulas </b>are biig clouds made of dust that literally contain dust and gas.
        <li><a href=Galaxies.html>Galaxies</a></li>
         <b>galaxies</b> contain stars,planets e.t.c.Our galaxy is called the <b>Milky Way</b>
        <li><a href=Planets.html>planets</a></li>
         <b>planets</b> are heavenly bodies that have a <b>moon</b> orbiting them.
        <li><a href=Moons.html>Moons</a></li>
    </ul><b>moons</b> are celestial bodies that follow the planets they are orbiting.</br>
    The Earth's Moon is a dusty ball of rock, measuring 3,476km in diameter.</br> that's roughly
     a quarter of the size of Earth and yes "Moon" is the name of earth's Moon.
    </br> </br> </br> </br> </br> </br> </br> </br> 
         Did you know the temprature of space?
     According to data from the Cosmic Background Explorer (COBE) satellite, the
      temperature of space is 2.725K (2.725 degrees above absolute zero).
     <h3>if you ever wondered what can kill you in space?</h3><br>
     (i dont know who would think that?)</br> </br></br> </br>REAL SPOILER ALERT: The short answer is that the lack of oxygen would make you black out after about 15 seconds. 
     Then by about 90 seconds you are too far gone to be saved. So you would die from lack of oxygen well before the radiation and cold would 
     have time to kill you.
